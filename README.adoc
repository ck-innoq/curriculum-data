== How to contribute or participate
Create an issue, a merge- or pull-request

. Clone the repositoryâ€”including the submodule:
+
--
[source,shell]
----
Via SSH:
git clone git@github.com:isaqb-org/curriculum-data.git --recursive

Via HTTPS:
git clone https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-data.git --recursive
----
--

. Build the project with http://www.gradle.com[gradle] (you need a locally installed JDK) via `./gradlew buildDocs`.
. Once "BUILD SUCCESSFUL" is shown, you can review the build result under `./build/index.html`

That will produce both pdf and html output in German (DE) _and_ English (EN), unless you modify the configuration.

In case you want to change that, adjust the following part of `build.gradle`:

[source,groovy]
----
task buildDocs {
  group 'Documentation'
  description 'Grouping task for generating all languages in several formats'
  dependsOn "renderNoRemarksDE", "renderNoRemarksEN", "renderWithRemarksDE", "renderWithRemarksEN"
}
----

so the contributors of that project basically contributed to this one, too.
